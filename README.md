# YOLO5Landmark 
YOLO5Landmard is based on the YOLOPose model to achieve the end-to-end facial landmard detection. Existing methods typically use two-stage approaches that first capture faces using advanced detectors or ground truth, then apply deep network to predict facial landmarks. However, these methods are not suitable for real-time applications especially on edge devices. Our framework can detect faces and their landmarks in one stage using an end-to-end way. We modify YOLO by setting multi-target labels to face label and adding an extra head for landmark localization. We also improve YOLO by using structural re-parameterization,
channel shuffling and implicit modules. Experiments on 300W show that YOLOLandmark achieves high accuracy and real-time speed compared with some selected state-of-the-art methods.

# YOLOV5-ti-lite Object Detection Models
This repository is based on [ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). As per the [Official Readme file from Ultralytics](./README_ultralytics.md), YOLOV5 is a family of object detectors with the following major differences from YOLOV3:
* Darknet-csp backbone instead of vanilla Darknet. Reduces complexity by 30%. 
* PANet feature extractor instead of FPN.
* Better box-decoding technique
* Genetic algorithm based anchor-box selection.
* Several new augmentation techniques. E.g. Mosaic augmentation

## **YOLOV5-ti-lite model definition**
* YOLOV5-ti-lite is a version of YOLOV5 from TI for efficient edge deployment. This naming convention is chosen to avoid conflict with future release of YOLOV5-lite models from Ultralytics.

* Here is a brief description of changes that were made to get yolov5-ti-lite from yolov5:
    * YOLOV5 introduces a Focus layer as the very first layer of the network. This replaces the first few heavy convolution layers that are present in YOLOv3. It reduces the complexity of the n/w by 7% and training time by 15%. However, the slice operations in Focus layer are not embedded friendly and hence we replace it with a light-weight convolution layer. Here is a pictorial description of the changes from YOLOv3 to YOLOv5 to YOLOv5-ti-lite:
    <p align="left"><img width="800" src="utils/figures/Focus.png"></p>     

    * SiLU activation is not well-supported in embedded devices. it's not quantization friendly as well because of it's unbounded nature. This was observed for hSwish activation function while [quantizing efficientnet](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/higher-accuracy-on-vision-models-with-efficientnet-lite.html). Hence, SiLU activation is replaced with ReLU.
    * SPP module with maxpool(k=13, s=1), maxpool(k=9,s=1) and maxpool(k=5,s=1) are replaced with various combinations of maxpool(k=3,s=1).Intention is to keep the receptive field and functionality same. This change will cause no difference to the model in floating-point.
        *	maxpool(k=5, s=1) -> replaced with two maxpool(k=3,s=1)
        *	maxpool(k=9, s=1) -> replaced with four maxpool(k=3,s=1) 
        *   maxpool(k=13, s=1)-> replaced with six maxpool(k=3,s=1) as shown below:
        <p align="left"><img width="800" src="utils/figures/max_pool.png"></p> 
        
    * Variable size inference is replaced with fixed size inference as preferred by edge devices. E.g. tflite models are exported with a fixed i/p size.
## **Training and Testing** 
* Training any model using this repo will take the above changes by default. Same commands as the official one can be used for training models from scartch. E.g.
    ```
    python train.py --data coco.yaml --cfg yolov5s6.yaml --weights '' --batch-size 64
                                           yolov5m6.yaml
    ``` 
* Yolov5-l6-ti-lite model is finetuned for 100 epochs from the official ckpt. To replicate the results for yolov5-l6-ti-lite, download the official pre-trained weights for yolov5-l6 and set the lr to 1e-3 in [hyp.scratch.yaml](data/hyp.scartch.yaml)
    ```
    python train.py --data coco.yaml --cfg yolov5l6.yaml --weights 'yolov5l6.pt' --batch-size 40
    ```
* Pretrained model checkpoints along with onnx and prototxt files are kept inside [pretrained_models](./pretrained_models). 
* Run the following command to replicate the accuracy number on the pretrained checkpoints:
    ```
    python val.py --data coco.yaml --img 640 --conf 0.001 --iou 0.65 --weights pretrained_models/yolov5s6_640_ti_lite/weights/best.pt
                                                                                                  yolov5m6_640_ti_lite
                                                                                                  yolov5l6_640_ti_lite
    ```

There are three models in the  [pretrained_models](./pretrained_models). All other results are generated for these model on a different resolution. In order to generate the accuracy number at 512x512, run the following:
   
```
python test.py --data coco.yaml --img 512 --conf 0.001 --iou 0.65 --weights pretrained_models/yolov5s6_640_ti_lite/weights/best.pt
                                                                                              yolov5m6_640_ti_lite
                                                                                              yolov5l6_640_ti_lite
```

###  **ONNX export including detection:**
* Run the following command to export the entire models including the detection part, 
``` 
    python export.py --weights pretrained_models/yolov5s6_640_ti_lite/weights/best.pt  --img 640 --batch 1 --simplify --export-nms --opset 11 # export at 640x640 with batch size 1
```
* Apart from exporting the complete ONNX model, above script will generate a prototxt file that contains information of the detection layer. This prototxt file is required to deploy the moodel on TI SoC.
